# SQL To-Do List



## Description
_Duration: 1 Week_

In this project a user can input a task (One input element) and add to their to-do list. The input is captured and the data is stored in a SQL Database. The tasks that are created then render in the Tasks to Complete area. Two buttons will appear on each task allowing user to [Complete] or [Delete] the task. If the user decides to [Complete] the task, the task is rendered in the Completed Tasks area. The user can [Delete] tasks which will remove from the DOM and the database.
